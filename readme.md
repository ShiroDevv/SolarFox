# Solar fox
## When this comes back into development, it will probably be incorperated into my website

A coding editor designed specifically for Lunar fox

## Note :
I am going to try and make it support other languages, and support extensions

### Server

### Currently only renders text.

### Setup:
In the server folder, there is a file called ".env_example", just go ahead and rename that to .env, and fill out the fields

After that, just run npm setup. This will install the dependencies, and run it in debug mode.

For debugging logs, use "npm run debug"

For normal use, use "npm run server"

### Features
#### (partial) Support for js highlighting

Cant show rn, I'll update this when I get the ability to.

#### Support for syntax highlighting extensions!
