# You found the extensions area!
## Currently only syntax extensions are supported.

[Link to guide](../../../guides/syntax_extension_development.md)

## File location doesnt matter. This is just how I am doing it.
You could do extensions/foo/bar/syn/tax/js/javascript.json

if you wanted to you could also delete the syntaxes in here, to make your own.
(Colliding syntaxes will use the first detected one.)
